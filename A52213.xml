            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HE that by himſelf or by any other, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any dangerous enterpriſe without foreſeeing the end and Iſſue thereof, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf and others into peril; This hath been a received maxim, and newly verified by the late overthrow given to the forces lately landed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (reported to be of <hi>Montroſses</hi> party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly of <hi>Sweads</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>) of which their is intelligence come hither this day, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a great overthrow, by a party of Lieut. Gen. <hi>David Leſtlies,</hi> who (ſaith ſome Letters) have rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, killed and taken at leaſt three thouſand, amongſt whom <hi>Hurry</hi> himſelf, is reported to be one of the Priſoners taken, and others of great quality; which comming from ſuch hands, as we have no cauſe to queſtion the truth thereof, puts me in mind of an old Proverb, <hi>viz.

            <p>Foure <hi>Straights</hi> Ships are come into this Harbor, (beſides two <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships hereafter mentioned) the Seamen report that many <hi>Pyrats</hi> infeſt the narrow Seas: the clearing of the Coaſts of ſuch implacable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, would be a great incouragement to <hi>Merchants,</hi> and therefore we are very joyful to hear that there is a gallant Fleet prepared by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and as we are informed, is already fallen into the <hi>Downes,</hi> the knowledge whereof, ſtrikes a terror into the Enemy, who having perſiſted in their obſtinacy, deſerve not the leaſt favour; for how can it be ſafe for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> not to revenge ſuch injuries done to the State: A Maſter of one of theſe Ships ſaith, that he heard that there was with Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Lisborne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Pluncket,</hi> Gapt. <hi>Muckell,</hi> and ſeveral others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for their Rebellious actings againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>England;</hi> but what hath been done ſince the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portingall</hi> refuſed to protect them, he knoweth not for that it is ſome weeks ſince he had this Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, it is not onely my opinion, but the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many others, well wiſhers to the peace and tranquility of this Nation, that if men would conſider how much it gives advantage to the common Enemy, which ſtudy nothing ſo much, as to find an advantage to bring us into new miſeries, there would not be ſuch diviſions amongſt men; but every one ſhould rather joyn together as one for defence of the whole body, and lay aſide back-bitings, and reproachful ſpeeches which are oftentimes the cauſe of much evill, and draweth others to do ſome things which may be thought unreaſonable. Theſe kinds of diſtempers are commonly moved firſt in diſquiet ſpirits, who ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110525:3"/>crave more then is fit to be granted, looking rather on what they fancy to be good, or in their own private judgments imagine to be evil, then to inform themſelves, that the firſt degree to attain vertue and honeſty, is to obey the Lawes, and reverence thoſe that are in Authority over us, and for want of a due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hereof, many have plunged themſelves into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers, and cauſe feares and jealouſies where needeth not any; for as all men ought to be governed by Lawes and certain Rules, ſo ought there to be ſome perſons that ſhall put thoſe Lawes in execution, and thereby govern the people: <hi>Scipio</hi> ſaith, it is the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors endeavour to get a faire paſſage, the travel of the <hi>Phiſician</hi> tendeth to health, and a Captains labor is for victory: ſo ſhould it be the glory and vertue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very privat man, to be dilligent in his Calling, and not to meddle with thoſe things that are too high for him.</p>
            <p>This advice I have thought good to remember you of, yet it is not becauſe you have occaſion to make uſe thereof in your own particular; but to the end you may as oppertunity is miniſtred, perſwade with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom you find averſe and obſtinate, and would ſtir up ſuch Coales which ſhould not onely ſet their Neighbors, but their own houſe on fire. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to our Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Two gallant Ships are arrived in this Harbor, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to London Marchants, they are richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and intend by the next fair wind, to hoiſt ſail for the port of London, to which place, we make not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtion but they may come with ſafety. The Sea-men in the ſaid Ships, expreſs a very good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110525:4"/>to the Parliament of England, and ſay that they will willingly ſacrifice their lives upon occaſion for defence of this Common-Wealth, under the preſent Government, without King or Houſe of Lords, which is the more remarkable, in reſpect the ſaid words were uttered before they heard of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or had it tendered unto any of them. Theſe Seamen are come home very rich, and do much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſs of ſome of their Country men, whom they hear to be lately taked by the <hi>French,</hi> yet if any ſuch thing hath been done, the Parliaments and cheif Governors of that Nation, are ſaid to be no abetters or countinancers thereof, preſſing rather a deſire of a continuance of a League and friendſhip, then to grant Letters of Mart. The laſt Ship taken, was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable value, and was not taken without a hot fight, and the loſs of many men; and although in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the <hi>French,</hi> as ſuch as were with them (men of War and of greater force then their competitors) might get the better at firſt, yet be it known unto the whole world, that the enterpriſes of Pirats and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed perſons are dangerous, and ſeldom come to a good end.</p>
            <p>About three days ſince here arrived a man of War, which bringeth intelligence, that as they ſtroke into harbor on the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> they heard it related, that the King of <hi>Portingal</hi> had given P. <hi>Rupert</hi> a day certain to put forth to Sea, not permiting him to ſtay beyond the time limited in any of his Harbors; and the time being expired, it is reported that there hath been a great fight betwixt him, and Collonel <hi>Blake,</hi> in which conflict the victory is given to the ſaid Collonel <hi>Blake,</hi> and 5: of P. <hi>Ruperts</hi> Ships, are ſaid to be ſunk
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110525:4"/>and taken, without the loſs of one of ours; but of this, I ſuppoſe you have better intelligence at London then any with us.</p>
            <p>Having taken liberty thus freely to diſcourſe of ſuch things, which either hapen here or are credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by good hands, give me leave to enlarge my ſelf a little further, in acquainting you what we hear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a plantation belonging to the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> called the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> about which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter the laſt night, what your intelligence was at LONDON, which came onely from a privat hand, and renders no reaſon but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame; yet for that, <hi>I</hi> have heard that vulgar reports are not always ſo much to be ſlighted, as that no anſwer at all were neceſſary to be returned, <hi>I</hi> ſhall make bold to inform you, in breif what is related here by the Sea-men, touching that buſineſs, which (ſay they) is only thus; An unskilful Pilot miſſing his compaſs, and thereby failing of the intended harbor, to vindicate his own reputation perſwaded the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the Iſland was removed out of the place in which it formerly ſtood: And how far his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick might ſway their beleif in this kind I know not, but of this <hi>I</hi> am ſure, that it gains little credit of any others that hear thereof.</p>
